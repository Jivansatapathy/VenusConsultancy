# CSS Loading Error Fix

## Issue
Next.js 16 is having issues loading CSS chunks for components, especially with Turbopack enabled.

## Solution Applied

1. ✅ **Disabled Turbopack** - Temporarily disabled to fix CSS chunk loading
2. ✅ **Updated Webpack Config** - Added CSS loader configuration
3. ✅ **Cleared Build Cache** - Removed `.next` and `node_modules/.cache`
4. ✅ **Direct Imports** - Removed lazy loading for components with CSS

## Next Steps

1. **Restart dev server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. **If error persists, try:**
```bash
# Complete clean
rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache
npm run dev
```

3. **If still having issues, rebuild:**
```bash
rm -rf .next node_modules
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Why This Happens

Next.js 16 with Turbopack can have issues with CSS code splitting. By disabling Turbopack and ensuring proper webpack configuration, CSS should load correctly.
